# Project-Wishlist   üéÅ
## Objective
**Develop an platform to** bring together the gift giver and receiver and facilitate the exchange of gifts. An all encompassing gift giving platform from the discovery of people's desired presents to the completed delivery.

**For family members and friends** who thoughtfully give but dislike the hastle and worry.

**In a world where** people's desired gifts are unknown and digital gift giving is a tumultuous process

**We aim to offer** both the gift giver and reciever a platform to handle all gift giving related processes

**Depends on the assumption** that gift giving digitally is unecessarily complicated
