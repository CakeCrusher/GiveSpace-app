## Objective
Create and share wishlists with ease.

## Description
- Make gift-giving effortless and fun
- Easily create and share wishlists
- Connect with friends and family
- Organize with others to give meaningful gifts

GiveSpace makes it easy to make your wishlist and share it with others. The app recognizes your list’s items and automatically fills in the details. It's that simple.
Find your friends and family on the app to view their lists and give the perfect gift. Lists will mark which items have been bought, so there’s no risk of unwanted duplicates.
GiveSpace is the ultimate tool for holidays, birthdays, weddings, baby showers, and more.



## Objective
**Develop an platform to** bring together the gift giver and receiver and facilitate the exchange of gifts. An all encompassing gift giving platform from the discovery of people's desired presents to the completed delivery.

**For family members and friends** who thoughtfully give presents but dislike the hastle and worry.

**In a world where** people's desired items are unknown and digital gift giving is a tumultuous process.

**We aim to offer** both the gift giver and reciever a platform to handle all gift giving related processes.

**Depends on the assumption** that gift giving digitally is unecessarily complicated.
